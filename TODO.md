# Things to do for Code

## Code Cleaning
- make it OS agnostic
- remove code that is not necessary
- make it into a package
- define static config file
- fix up Jupyter notebooks by removing code in notebooks for separate function files


## Tutorial
- replicate results we have in paper
- run in way that is not coupled with the library itself
	- replicate it independently
- provide example execution and models
	-  define README/tutorial for it
	-  explain how it works
- Jupyter notebook 
	- Code interpolation
- show how to add new neural network to program
	- in training utils... specify how to change code to run it
- super simple walk through
	- show it works for any kind of NN

## Documentation
- include diagram of how code runs
- provide example execution and models
	-  define README/tutorial for it
	-  explain how it works
- super simple walk through
	- show it works for any kind of NN
- mention how gridding is not NECESSARY for GENNI, user has control over exploration
